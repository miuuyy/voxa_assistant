Voxa AI is an **AI-powered voice assistant** that enables people with limited hand mobility to control their entire computer â€” **precisely, independently, and fully** â€” using only their voice.  
Itâ€™s not a concept or demo â€” this is a **fully functional, production-ready application** that you can install and start using today.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Click anywhere on screen** using a custom two-step visual recognition grid

## ðŸ›  How It Works

Voxa AI runs as a **desktop voice-first agent** with the following tech stack:

- **Python** backend for logic and control
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for reasoning and UI analysis
- **PyAutoGUI** for OS-level mouse and keyboard control
- **Google Speech API** for real-time speech recognition

### Dual-Grid Targeting System
1. **Coarse grid overlay** â€” divides the screen into large sections
2. **Gemini identifies target** â€” determines which section contains the desired element
3. **Fine grid overlay** â€” zooms into the section for precise targeting
4. **Pixel-perfect click** â€” executes the action exactly where needed

This allows control of **any app, on any screen**, without custom integrations or training.
