##How It Works

Voxa AI runs as a **desktop voice-first agent** with the following tech stack:

- **Python** backend for logic and control
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for reasoning and UI analysis
- **PyAutoGUI** for OS-level mouse and keyboard control
- **Google Speech API** for real-time speech recognition

### Dual-Grid Targeting System

1. **Coarse grid overlay** вЂ” divides the screen into large sections
2. **Gemini identifies target** вЂ” determines which section contains the desired element
3. **Fine grid overlay** вЂ” zooms into the section for precise targeting
4. **Pixel-perfect click** вЂ” executes the action exactly where needed

This allows control of **any app, on any screen**, without custom integrations or training.
